# Responsive Cogoport Home Page

## Steps to run this project in local machine :

2. open the project editor like VS CODE and run the project



## Problems faced while making the project
1. The responsiveness of my website almost matches with the original cogoport website ..  but there are minute erros.
   When we change the screen size the font size and some margins are not matching exactly with the original website
   There are very very minute erros of font sizing and alignments
2. when we reduce the screen less than 766px , sometimes (not always) , a right margin is getting added to the body of web page
3. some unkown vertical lines have occured in the Blogs section
